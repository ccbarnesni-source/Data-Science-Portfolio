# Statistics Exercises

This folder contains a series of Jupyter notebooks with statistics exercises. They also double as coding exercises. Each notebook is a collection from different textbooks that I have self-studied. The code is not necessarily designed to be the most elegant (there are many functions that directly compute the things I want to calculate) however doing the tests from scratch provides a useful learning exercise.
